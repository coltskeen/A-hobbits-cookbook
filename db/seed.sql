        'Melton Mowbray Pork Pie', 
        ARRAY ['500g plain flour', '170g lard', '143ml water', '3 1/2 tsp sea salt', '1 egg, beaten, to glaze', '600g lean shoulder of pork - chopped with a knife very small', '1 tsp freshly ground black pepper', '1.5kg pork bones', '4 large carrots, roughly chopped', '2 onion, peeled, roughly chopped', '2 Bay leaf', 'A few sprigs of thyme', 'A few sage leaves', '4 tsp whole black peppercorns (crushed lightly)', '2 pig''s trotters (to fit in a saucepan)'],
        ARRAY ['To make 1 pie: The Crust. 3/4 lb plain flour, 6 oz lard, 1/2 teaspoonful salt, 4 fluid oz water.', 'The Filling: 1 lb pork (failing flitch, use shoulder, and if bought buy 1 1/4 lb (625g) to allow trimming) 1 level teaspoonful salt, 1/2 level teaspoonful pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls water.', 'The Crust. Put lard and water in saucepan and bring to the boil to melt the lard. Meanwhile weigh and sieve flour and salt, then pour lard and water (while still boiling) over the flour and mix well. Knead well by hand. Leave to cool about and hour but during this time knead once or twice. The dough must not get really cold otherwise it will crack and crumble. Turn onto floured board. Flour mould (the traditional Leicestershire pie mould is wooden, but a 2 lb jam-jar will do), put crust on top of mould and shape it from the top some way down the sides. The crust should be about 1/3 inch (1cm) thick. Leave to set for 20 minutes, then turn crust of mould and trim with scissors.', 'The Filling. Mince the meat on coarse knife of mincer or chop finely with a knife; add salt and pepper and mix in, add water and mix again. Press meat well into corners of pie, filling within 3/4 inch (2cm) of the top. Make the lid out of the pastry trimmings, press the edges together. Cut round to neaten off – this cutting also helps to bind the top and sides together. Castellate the top with thumb and first finger, make one hole with a skewer and decorate with stars or leaves. Cut a length of greaseproof paper about 1 inch (2.5cm) higher than the pie, wind it round the pie making sure it goes right down the bottom, and stick it together with flour paste. This holds the pie in position. The pie need not be baked on the same day – in fact it is improved by standing overnight. To cook, put the pie on a sandwich tin with 1 inch (2.5cm) edges – allowing plenty of room around the pie – and place on baking tray. Cook at 350 degrees F (180C) for the first hour, then turn oven to 300 degrees F (160C) and give pie another 45 minutes. The sandwich tin will re-absorb the fat. When the pie is nearly cold make a small hole in the top and add jelly. The jelly is made from bones and rind, just covered with water, simmered for 2 hours, then strained and seasoned. It should be poured into pie 1 hour after it comes out of oven.', 'Pork Stock: For the pork stock place all of the ingredients into a large saucepan and pour in enough water to just cover them (about 4 litres). Bring this slowly to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer for three hours over a low heat, without a lid to aid evaporation, and skim off any impurities which rise to the surface. After 3 hours strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve into another saucepan, jug or bowl and discard the larger solids. Then sieve this liquid for a second time through an even finer sieve, or better still, through a sieve covered over with a muslin cloth to completely catch all the small particles. This traditional pork stock can now be used in soups, or simmered and reduced further to use as a base for a gravy or a sauce etc.', 'Pork Jelly: For the pork jelly, place all of the ingredients into a large saucepan and pour in enough water to just cover them (about 4 litres). Bring this slowly to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer for three hours over a low heat, without a lid to aid evaporation, and skim off any impurities which rise to the surface. After 3 hours strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve into another saucepan, jug or bowl and discard the larger solids. Then sieve this liquid for a second time through an even finer sieve, or better still, through a sieve covered over with a muslin cloth to completely catch all the small particles. This will make the stock into a clear jelly when set. Simmer this clear stock over a medium heat until the liquid has evaporated and further reduced to just under 600ml. As it is left to cool it will start to thicken and set, (you may need to heat it through gently for only a minute to loosen the mixture for pouring when needed for the pork pies).'],

        'There really is no other pork pie quite it''s equal. Melton, in Mowbray, Leicestershire, is the area located from where these famous Victorian pies were first sold (from the 1830''s). Made with a hot water crust pastry and proper pork "jelly" this would have been a firm favourite taken at tea. Today, when people say pork pie, this is the standard pie they think of.'

You''ll want the shortening to create a clumpy sand texture with the flour. Next, add your cold butter.  Slicing the butter will help incorporate into the flour easier but cubes of butter will work as well.  Work the butter into the flour until it creates hazelnut size pieces.  Add the ice cold water and mix just until the flour is hydrated.  Wrap with plastic wrap and place it into the refrigerate for 20 minutes.','Meanwhile, prepare your pastry cream by heating the milk on medium heat until it comes to a simmer.  In mixing bowl, combine your egg yolks, vanilla extract, sugar, salt, flour, and cornstarch.  Mix until combined.  Once the milk comes to a simmer, pour a quarter of it into the yolk mixture.  Immediately stir to combine. Continue to temper the yolks with the hot milk.  Once that is done, pour the mixture back into the pot over medium heat.  Continue to whisk the mixture as it thickens.  Let it come to a boil for a minute or two to ensure that the flour has been cooked through.  Strain and cover directly with plastic wrap.  Place it into an ice bath and let it cool down.','While the pastry cream is cooling, preheat your oven to 350F and place your dough on a lightly floured surface.  Cut the dough into five equal pieces.  Take one piece and roll it out.  Try to keep it as rectangular as possible or with whatever shape you are deciding to use.  Transfer the dough into the tart pan and gently press in the edges and corners.  Dock with a fork and continue the same process with the rest of the tarts.  Bake at 350F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.  Let the tart shells cool after baking.','Once the pastry cream is cool, loosen it with a spatula or in a mixing bowl with a paddle attachment.  If you find the cream is too thick, you can loosen it with heavy cream.  Fill the tart shells with the cream and garnish with sliced blackberries.', 'Notes: Make sure to bake your tarts until it is golden brown because that will help ensure the crust will hold up to the pastry cream over time.  Some use an apricot glaze to layer the bottom to help with that issue.'],
